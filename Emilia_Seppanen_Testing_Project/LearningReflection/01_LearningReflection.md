> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- I found testing the app interesting but also challenging. Writing down all the steps took more time than I originally thought it would. As I have created some web apps in other courses it was now interesting to see and learn more about the testing side. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I started by looking at all the assignment details and given examples. 
I wrote the test description, pre and post conditions, tags and main variables.
Then I proceeded at writing a test cases from the examples.
I then wrote the steps for the step cases and executed these steps on the website.
During these steps I also added missing variables.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -    I think I did Test case management quite well, although this was the first time testing, there probably is a better and faster way of doing this which I don't yet know.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code as I am familiar with this IDE

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I had some difficulty finding some steps for the CRUD phase as I am new using GitLab. I had to use Google to help me locate these in order to proceed. I later also found these same instructions from Canvas too.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used Github before on previous coding and programming courses. I didn't have issues with it.
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- As I am not familiar with these frameworks, I had to do some research based on ease of use, languages used and platform support.
Robot Framework and Selenium both are stated to be easy to use, and they support Python and JavaScript, languages which I am familiar with and they support web apps.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Technical skills (programming languages & testing frameworks), problem solving, analytical skills, attention to detail, ability to create and manage test plans, collaboration/communication skills, AI & Machine learning


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Technical skills: Automation frameworks, required programming languages, more practise on testing in general.
- Soft skills: analytical skills, communication skills, problem solving skills


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think the theory was quite overwhelming for me and I was quite scared strating this assingment thinking it would be as challenging as the theory part. I was happy to be proven wrong and found the actual testing and writing test cases easier. Having done the theory part obviously helped with the testing as well.
